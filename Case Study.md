# Hypothetical Scenario:

#### Imagine Tech University’s IT team is planning to move their computer systems from their own servers to the AWS Cloud. They’re looking to do this to make their systems more flexible and scalable, save on costs, and better handle their increasing needs for data storage and computing power.

# Restated Hypothetical Scenario:

#### Tech University is thinking about moving its IT systems to AWS Cloud. This move could help the university by making it easier to scale up resources as needed, saving money on hardware, and providing more storage and computing power to support its growing activities and research.

# Unique Case Study

## Background:
Tech University, a school known for its research and tech innovation, currently runs a traditional data center on its campus. This data center handles everything from administrative systems and student records to research and educational tools. However, as the amount of data and need for computing power grow, the old setup is becoming too costly to maintain and isn't flexible enough. To solve these issues, the IT department has decided to move everything to AWS Cloud.

## Migration Plan:

**Phase 1: Assessment and Planning**
- **Current Infrastructure Overview**:
  - **Servers**: 150 physical servers, various ages and capacities.
  - **Storage**: They have 500 TB of data spread across several storage systems.
  - **Applications**: They use systems for student information (SIS), learning management (LMS), research databases, and email.
  - **Networking**: Their network is outdated with limited backup options.

**Costs**:
- **Annual Maintenance**: $500,000.
- **Energy Consumption**: 1.2 million kWh per year.
- **Staff**: 10 full-time IT staff dedicated to maintenance.

**Challenges**:
- **Scalability**: Limited ability to handle peak loads during registration and exams.
- **Costs**: High energy and maintenance costs.
- **Data Security**: Concerns over data security and compliance with educational regulations.

**AWS Migration Goals**:
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling to handle peak loads.
- **Cost Reduction**: Aim to reduce operational costs by 30%.
- **Enhanced Security**: Utilize AWS’s robust security features and compliance certifications.

## Phase 2: Migration Execution
- **Migration Strategy**:
  - **Lift and Shift**: Move existing applications to AWS with minimal modifications.
  - **Replatforming**: Update some applications to take advantage of AWS services.
  - **Refactoring**: Redesign a few critical applications for cloud-native functionality.

**Key AWS Services**:
- **Compute**: EC2 instances for scalable virtual servers.
- **Storage**: S3 for data storage, RDS for relational databases.
- **Networking**: VPC for network isolation, Direct Connect for dedicated connections.
- **Security**: IAM for access management, AWS Shield for DDoS protection.

**Migration Timeline**:
- **Month 1-2**: Assessment and planning.
- **Month 3-4**: Lift and shift migration of non-critical applications.
- **Month 5-6**: Replatforming of critical applications.
- **Month 7-8**: Refactoring and optimization.
- **Month 9-10**: Testing and validation.
- **Month 11-12**: Full deployment and monitoring.

## Phase 3: Post-Migration Analysis
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Scalability Improvements**: Measure system performance during peak times.
  - **Cost Savings**: Compare pre and post-migration costs.
  - **Energy Consumption**: Assess reduction in energy usage.

**Feedback and Iteration**:
- **Student and Faculty Feedback**: Collect feedback on system performance and usability.
- **IT Staff Insights**: Gather insights from IT staff on the migration process and ongoing management.
